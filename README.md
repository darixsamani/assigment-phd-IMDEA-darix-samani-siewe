### Milan Telecom Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation related to my application for the PhD position at IMDEA Networks Institute. The project focuses on analyzing internet traffic activity in Milan using the Big Data Challenge dataset, which was collected over two months from November to December 2013.

The primary objective of this work is to predict internet activity in Milan for the period from December 16 to December 22, based on patterns observed in historical data.


### Structure of this Work

Our work is structured as follows:

- **`dataset/` folder**: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets required to run the notebooks(20G).

- **Two Jupyter notebooks**:
  - The first notebook focuses on data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
  - The second notebook contains the core implementation related to our predictive modeling and analysis.
    
    
 

### How Jupyter Notebook

We chose to use Jupyter Notebooks to ensure our work is reproducible, well-documented, and easy to follow.

#### How to Run the Cod

To run the code for this project, please follow these steps:

- The notebook `preprocessing_data.ipynb` contains all the code related to processing and cleaning the dataset.  
  **Note:** Due to the large size of the dataset, it is not included directly in this repository.

- The notebook `home_work_code.ipynb` contains the complete implementation of our analysis and modeling pipeline.
